Project Description

UK food/restaurant data in json format is extracted and formatted for use in a mongo database. A new restaurant was added, a local authority's data was deleted, and the data was converted to appropriate types. An analysis was run using pymongo queries and pipelines to find the top places to eat nearby the newly added restaurant, and the worst local authorities based on restaurant hygiene scores.

Execution

Execute NoSQL_setup_start.ipynb to import establishments.json file using a terminal command found in the first markdown cell, or using the included !mongoimport command seen in the cell after dependencies. Then, execute NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb for analysis.

Features

This project contains jupyter notebook code. Pymongo, pprint, and pandas modules were used for data manipulation and analysis.
